The jupyter notebook IDE used for this project was Google Colaboratory.
Therefore, execution steps also assume a Google Colaboratory environment.

How to run:
1. Upload supplied .csv dataset to session storage in the files tab
2. Runtime -> Run all

Legacy code and hypertuning code cells are prepended with 

%%script echo pass

to prevent long execution time. The report is written using the values as seen in the output.
If you would like to run these cells manually, comment out each %% line and execute with Runtime -> Run all.
Variable names in some cells are defined in prior cells, please always use Runtime -> Run all to prevent scope issues.
